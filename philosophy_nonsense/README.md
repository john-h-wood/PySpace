# Philosophy Nonsense Generator
This script randomly selects words from lists according to 'forms,' code sequences for types of sentences. For example, `N V A` might stand for 'noun-verb-abjective,' and random words of each type get chosen to 'decode the form.'

The generator is designed to sound like it is using fancy words for the sake of... using fancy words.
